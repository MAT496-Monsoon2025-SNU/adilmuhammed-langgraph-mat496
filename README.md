Module 1
Video 1 — Motivation

Learnings:

In video 1 we got a brief explanation of why langgraph is used in the first place, its to balance reliabity and control of the llm. There were no specific topics covered in this video just a overview of what we are going to do in each module. No codes were given in this video.

Video 2 — Simple graph

Learnings:

In this video I learned how the basics of nodes and graph workings and how to create them. In the code we used we still haven't used llm to decide which node to choose. For now we used random number generation for outcome. The general idea was similar to neural networks.

Code Changes:

Added a new block to test the selection of node by random generation

Video 3 — LangSmith Studio

Learnings:

In this video we used the studio interface in langsmith for first time. This is used for debugging and reviewing different cases, to get a better understanding of our structure at t gives a great visual repsentation etc.
There was no code in this video

Video 4 — Chain

Learnings:

In this video we learned to build simple chain in graph using chat messages. We also learned implementing tool calling which we had learned before to graph.

Code Changes:

Made neccessary changes for code to run and changed the tool which was used

Notebooks:
